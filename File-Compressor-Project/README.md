===========

To do:
* Binary files, like jpeg,mp3 support
* Run scan to group repeating bit patterns, not bit.
* Unicode support
* Move entire codebase to python, use neural network to compress files.

# File Compression Using Huffman Algorithm

This program compresses and decompresses files using the Huffman algorithm. It replaces frequent characters with shorter binary codes for efficient compression. The original file can be restored without data loss.

## Usage

### Compression
```
./Encode <file to compress>
```
Creates a compressed file named `<inputfile>.spd`.

### Decompression
```
./Decode <file to decompress>
```
Restores the original file from the `.spd` file.
